- Cost increase: ~$15 ‚Üí ~$47 per 1M chars

### Phase 2: Quality Upgrade (ElevenLabs)
- Add ElevenLabs Flash as secondary option
- Use for important/customer-facing responses
- Keep Cartesia for quick responses
- **Expected result:** Best quality + best speed

### Phase 3: Optimization
- Pre-cache common phrases with both providers

## Expected User Experience Improvement

**Current (OpenAI):**
```
User: "What's the weather?"
[2.4 second pause]
Dashie: "The weather is sunny and 72 degrees"
```

**With Cartesia Sonic:**
```
User: "What's the weather?"
[0.09 second pause - barely noticeable]
Dashie: "The weather is sunny and 72 degrees"
```

**With ElevenLabs Flash:**
```
User: "What's the weather?"
[0.15 second pause - feels instant]
Dashie: [Most natural voice] "The weather is sunny and 72 degrees"
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Get Cartesia API key** - cartesia.ai/signup
2. **Create Cartesia edge function** - Similar to openai-tts
3. **Test latency improvement** - Should see 26x speedup
4. **Evaluate quality** - Compare naturalness to OpenAI/Android
5. **Consider ElevenLabs** - If quality is priority over cost

## Android Voice Quality Note

You mentioned Android's Google TTS is more natural than OpenAI. Here's why:

- **Android uses Google Neural2 or WaveNet** - High-quality voices
- **OpenAI TTS is decent but not top-tier** for naturalness
- **ElevenLabs Flash > Google Neural2 > OpenAI** in quality rankings
- **Cartesia Sonic ‚âà OpenAI** in quality, but 26x faster

**Recommendation:** Use ElevenLabs Flash to match/exceed Android quality while maintaining cloud consistency.
