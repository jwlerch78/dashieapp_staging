# Phase 0: Technical Feasibility Tests - Quick Reference

**Timeline:** Week 1-2 (before main implementation)  
**Goal:** Validate critical technical assumptions before building full system

---

## The Three Critical Questions

### 1. Wake Word Detection Feasibility
**Question:** Can we reliably detect wake words via USB microphone on Fire TV?

**Test App:** Minimal Android app with wake word detection + transcription  
**Duration:** 2-3 days  
**Success Criteria:**
- Wake word detection: >90% from 6-10 feet
- False positives: <3 per hour
- Transcription accuracy: >80%

**Test Procedure:**
```
1. Say wake word from various distances (3ft, 6ft, 10ft)
2. Record success rates
3. Test with background noise (TV, conversation)
4. Measure false positives over 2-hour period
5. Test common phrases:
   - "Where is Mary?"
   - "What's the weather today?"
   - "Show me the calendar"
```

### 2. Text-to-Speech Quality
**Question:** Is Android TTS voice quality acceptable for family use?

**Test App:** Android app with text input + TTS controls  
**Duration:** 1-2 days  
**Success Criteria:**
- Voice clarity: >4/5 rating from family
- Natural cadence (no robotic pauses)
- Audible from 10-15 feet away

**Test Messages:**
```
Short:
- "Mary is at the grocery store."
- "The weather today is 75 degrees and sunny."
- "You have 3 calendar events today."

Long:
- "Mary is currently at Publix on Main Street, about 2 miles from home. 
   She was last there 5 minutes ago."

Errors:
- "Sorry, I didn't catch that. Could you try again?"
- "I need an internet connection for that command."
```

**Test Procedure:**
```
1. Play preset messages at various rates/pitches
2. Have 3-5 family members rate each (1-5 scale):
   - Clarity
   - Natural sound
   - Pleasantness
   - Understandability
3. Test in living room at viewing distance
4. Compare to Alexa/Google Assistant
5. Identify optimal rate/pitch settings
```

### 3. Claude API Framework
**Question:** Can we build a prompt that Claude understands reliably?

**Test App:** Node.js terminal REPL  
**Duration:** 2-3 days  
**Success Criteria:**
- Command matching: >90% accuracy
- JSON parsing: >95% success rate
- Response latency: <3 seconds

**Test Commands:**
```
Dashboard commands (should match menu):
âœ“ "where is Mary"
âœ“ "show Mary's calendar"
âœ“ "what's the weather"
âœ“ "show photos from last week"
âœ“ "navigate to calendar view"
âœ“ "remind me to pick up groceries at 5pm"

Off-menu queries (should return independent_response):
âœ“ "what time do the Buccaneers play"
âœ“ "who won the election"
âœ“ "what's 15% of 250"

Ambiguous commands (test edge cases):
âœ“ "Mary" (incomplete)
âœ“ "where" (missing subject)
âœ“ "show me" (missing object)
```

**Test Procedure:**
```
1. Run: node test-claude-api.js
2. Test each command type
3. Verify correct action type and parameters
4. Measure latency over 20 requests
5. Optimize system prompt
6. Test error scenarios
```

## Decision Gate (End of Week 2)

### Scoring System

| Component | Green (Go) | Yellow (Adjust) | Red (Stop) |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **Wake Word** | >90% detection<br><3 false pos/hr | 80-90% detection<br>3-5 false pos/hr | <80% detection<br>>5 false pos/hr |
| **TTS Quality** | >4/5 family rating | 3-4/5 rating | <3/5 rating |
| **Claude Framework** | >90% accuracy | 80-90% accuracy | <80% accuracy |

### Possible Outcomes

âœ… **All Green â†’ Proceed to Phase 1 (Week 3)**
- All critical components validated
- Build complete system as planned
- 10-week timeline to production

ðŸŸ¡ **Some Yellow â†’ Adjust & Proceed (Week 4)**
- Tune wake word sensitivity
- Adjust TTS settings
- Refine Claude prompts
- Add 1-2 weeks to timeline

ðŸ”´ **Any Red â†’ Re-evaluate**
- Consider alternative wake word engines
- Explore cloud TTS services
- Simplify Claude prompts
- Architecture changes needed
- Timeline extends significantly

## Deliverables

After Phase 0, you will have:

1. **Three working test applications:**
   - `dashie-wake-word-test.apk`
   - `dashie-tts-quality-test.apk`
   - `test-claude-api.js` (Node.js script)

2. **Technical feasibility report:**
   - Quantitative metrics for all three tests
   - Family feedback on TTS quality
   - Claude accuracy test results
   - Recommendations for adjustments

3. **Go/No-Go decision:**
   - Clear assessment of technical viability
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Updated timeline and architecture (if needed)

4. **Optimized configurations:**
   - Best wake word sensitivity setting

**Remember:** The goal of Phase 0 is to **fail fast and cheaply**. Better to discover problems in 2 weeks of isolated testing than 8 weeks into building the full system.

**If any component fails to meet criteria, you can:**
- Adjust parameters (sensitivity, prompt, etc.)
- Try alternative approaches (different wake word engine, cloud TTS)
- Simplify requirements (reduce accuracy threshold)
- Re-evaluate architecture

**Success in Phase 0 means confidence to invest 10+ weeks building the full system.**

**Next Step:** Set up development environment and begin Test #1 (Wake Word Detection)
